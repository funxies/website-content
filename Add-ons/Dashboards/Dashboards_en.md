## Overview
This component enables creating and embedding dashboards into your application screens. Dashboards allow visualizing summarized information, data sets, charts and can be accessible only by authorized users. 

A dashboard consists of widgets â€” individual elements based on a frame.  An integrated set of layouts allows positioning widgets on a dashboard according to your needs. Use responsive layouts to adapt your dashboards to different displays.

You can add chart widgets based on data from reports using [Dashboard Chart Add-on](https://github.com/cuba-platform/dashboard-chart-addon).
